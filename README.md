# Instra-Hotel
 
I have done a project in my high school, class 12th. The project was based on the connection between Java and MySQL database using the Java JDBC driver.
It was done using the NetBeans IDE. The form was made using JFrame and their source code .It was a hotel registration form, from the menu we can go to either enter our booking details , or login to the hotel database , or check their reservation bills.
From the home page, you can either go to the login page, or to the booking details page, or to the reservation slip page.
